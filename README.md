# Creating a Twitter Clone

For this bootacmp assignment we were tasked to create part of the React functionality for a twitter clone.

We had to use the useState hook to change the number of likes the tweet has when it's posted, and to change the heart icon when the post is liked

From this we were able to learn how useState can be the backbone for the functionality of a website!
